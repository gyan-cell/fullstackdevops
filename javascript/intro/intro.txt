JavaScript is a scripting or programming language ,
    that allows you to implement complex features on web pages 
    — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
    for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
    animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video 
    jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
    It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS)
  we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.


  The DOM (Document Object Model) API allows you to manipulate HTML
  and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, 
   dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc.
   Every time you see a popup window appear on a page, or some new content
   displayed (as we saw above in our simple demo) for example, that's the DOM in action.

The Geolocation API retrieves geographical information. 
This is how Google Maps is able to find your location and plot it on a map.

The Canvas and WebGL APIs allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics.
People are doing some amazing things using these web technologies — see Chrome Experiments and webglsamples.


Audio and Video APIs like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia,
such as play audio and video right in a web page
or grab video from your web camera and display it on 
someone else's computer (try our simple Snapshot demo to get the idea).

JavaScript running order

When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom.
This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in.
For example, let's return to the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:

const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", updateName);

function updateName() {
  const name = prompt("Enter a new name");
  button.textContent = `Player 1: ${name}`;
}



JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. 
The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that.
From a technical standpoint, most modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called
just-in-time compiling to improve performance; 
the JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used,
    so that it can be run as quickly as possible.
    However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted language,
    since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.


Client side code runs on users computer || Server side code runs on server , 
then its results are downloaded and displayed in browseer.
