 we discuss math in JavaScript — how we can use operators
 and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.


 Types of Numbers : 
 We use different terms to describe different type of decimal no. in JavaScript.

 Integers : We all know integers are no . without the fractional parts , They can be either 
 positive or negative.

 Floating Point Numbers :
 Floating point numbers are numbers with decimal points.

 We have different types of numbers Systems.
 Binary : The Lowest level language that we use is binary consisting of 0 and 1 of base 2.
 ocatal : The number system that we use is octal system consisting of 0 to 7 of base 8.
 Hexadecimal : The number system that we use is hexadecimal system consisting
 of 0 to 9 and A to F in order of base 16.

unlike some other programming languages,
JavaScript only has one data type for numbers, both integers and decimals — you guessed it, Number.
This means that whatever type of numbers you are dealing with in JavaScript,
you handle them in exactly the same way.

JavaScript has a second number type called bigint used for a very  very large integers.

how to declare number : 
const myInt = 5;
const myFloat = 6.667;
myInt;
myFloat;


Numbers are the types of Objects So all the Methods of Object  Will Still Work on Numbers.


Method                  	Description
toString()	              Returns a number as a string
toExponential()	          Returns a number written in exponential notation
toFixed()	                Returns a number written with a number of decimals
toPrecision()	            Returns a number written with a specified length
valueOf()	                Returns a number as a number


Number() can also convert a date to a number.
Number(new Date("1970-01-01"))
The Date() method returns the number of milliseconds since 1.1.1970.


Number.isInteger()      	Returns true if the argument is an integer
Number.isSafeInteger()	  Returns true if the argument is a safe integer
Number.parseFloat()     	Converts a string to a number
Number.parseInt()	        Converts a string to a whole number


Number Methods Cannot be Used on Variables
The number methods above belong to the JavaScript Number Object.

These methods can only be accessed like Number.isInteger().

Using X.isInteger() where X is a variable, will result in an error:

TypeError X.isInteger is not a function.
