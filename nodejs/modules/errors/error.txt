Errors in nodejs : 
Applications running in Node.js will generally experience four categories of errors:


Standard JavaScript errors such as <EvalError>, <SyntaxError>, <RangeError>, <ReferenceError>, <TypeError>, and <URIError>.
System errors triggered by underlying operating system constraints such as 
attempting to open a file that does not exist or attempting to send data over a closed socket.
User-specified errors triggered by application code.
AssertionErrors are a special class of error that can be triggered when Node.js detects an exceptional logic violation that should never occur. 
These are raised typically by the node:assert module.


Node.js supports several mechanisms for propagating and handling errors that occur while an application is running.
How these errors are reported and handled depends entirely on the type of Error and the style of the API that is called.

// Throws with a ReferenceError because z is not defined.
try {
  const m = 1;
  const n = m + z;
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the error here.
}

Any use of the JavaScript throw mechanism will raise an exception that must be handled or the Node.js process will exit immediately.
With few exceptions, Synchronous APIs (any blocking method that does not
return a <Promise> nor accept a callback function, such as fs.readFileSync), will use throw to report errors.

Error in async functions can be handled in various methods...

Some asynchronous methods returns a <Promise>, you should always take into account that it might be rejected.
See --unhandled-rejections flag for how the process will react to an unhandled promise rejection.

const fs = require('fs/promises');

(async () => {
  let data;
  try {
    data = await fs.readFile('a file that does not exist');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
    return;
  }
  // Otherwise handle the data
})();


Most asynchronous methods that accept a callback function will accept an Error object passed as the first argument to that function. 
If that first argument is not null and is an instance of Error, then an error occurred that should be handled.


const fs = require('node:fs');
fs.readFile('a file that does not exist', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
    return;
  }
  // Otherwise handle the data
});


When an asynchronous method is called on an object that is an EventEmitter, errors can be routed to that object's 'error' event.

const net = require('node:net');
const connection = net.connect('localhost');

// Adding an 'error' event handler to a stream:
connection.on('error', (err) => {
  // If the connection is reset by the server, or if it can't
  // connect at all, or on any sort of error encountered by
  // the connection, the error will be sent here.
  console.error(err);
});

connection.pipe(process.stdout);


A handful of typically asynchronous methods in the Node.js API may still use the throw mechanism to raise exceptions that must be handled using try…catch
. There is no comprehensive list of such methods; please refer to the documentation of each method to determine 
the appropriate error handling mechanism required.
