What is a Module in Node.js?
Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
A set of functions you want to include in your application.
Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.

Node.js HTTP Module

Node.js has a built-in HTTP module that you can use to send and receive HTTP requests and responses.

The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.

Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:

var http = require('http');

//create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
  res.end(); //end the response
}).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
